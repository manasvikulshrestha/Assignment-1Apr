    "1. **Difference between linear regression and logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - Linear regression is used for predicting continuous dependent variables based on one or more independent variables. It models the relationship between variables using a straight line.\n",
    "   - Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class using the logistic function, which maps any real-valued input into the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example scenario for logistic regression: Predicting whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0) based on features like email content, sender, subject line, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost function used in logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - The cost function used in logistic regression is the **log loss** (or cross-entropy loss) function.\n",
    "   - It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels.\n",
    "   - The goal is to minimize this cost function during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regularization in logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - Regularization in logistic regression involves adding a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - Two common types of regularization are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).\n",
    "   - Regularization helps in shrinking the coefficients of the model, preventing it from learning complex relationships that might be noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROC curve for evaluating logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a plot of the true positive rate (Sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - Specificity) for different threshold values.\n",
    "   - It helps visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "   - The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric to quantify the performance of a logistic regression model. Higher AUC indicates better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature selection techniques in logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - Common techniques include forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise selection, and regularization (L1 regularization specifically).\n",
    "   - These techniques help improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting, decreasing training time, and enhancing interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - Techniques for dealing with class imbalance include resampling methods (oversampling minority class, undersampling majority class), using different evaluation metrics (e.g., F1 score, precision-recall curve), and employing algorithmic techniques like cost-sensitive learning or using ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Common issues and challenges in logistic regression**:\n",
    "   - Multicollinearity among independent variables can cause issues by inflating standard errors of coefficients. Solutions include removing highly correlated variables or using regularization techniques.\n",
    "   - Other challenges include handling missing data, outliers, non-linearity, and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics based on the problem at hand."
